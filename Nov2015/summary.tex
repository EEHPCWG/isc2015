\section{Summary and Next Steps}
\label{summary}


In summary, we believe that the European ESP programs for DM need to be studied in greater detail, and the awareness of the benefits for these programs needs to be raised among the SCs. As part of our future work, we want to explore the European ESP programs further, the lack of such closer relationships, and also conduct a similar study in Japan, which has different institutional and electricity supply challenges. We also want to conduct more qualitative analysis through in-person site interviews to understand the electricity markets and the available incentive better.
